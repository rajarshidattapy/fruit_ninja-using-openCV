#Fruit Ninja Game using OpenCV

# Overview
Welcome to the Fruit Ninja Game implemented using OpenCV! This project recreates the classic Fruit Ninja game, where players slice fruits that appear on the screen. The game uses computer vision techniques to detect the player's hand gestures or mouse movements to simulate the slicing action.

# Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Computer Vision: OpenCV
Graphics: Pygame (for rendering and animations)

# Gameplay

In the game, fruits are thrown onto the screen, and the player must slice them by moving their hand (detected via a webcam) or using the mouse. The player scores points for each fruit sliced, and the game continues until a certain number of fruits are missed.

# Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
Webcam (for gesture detection)
